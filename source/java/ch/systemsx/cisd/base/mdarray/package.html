<title>Multi-dimensional arrays.</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
This package provides an implementation of multi-dimensional numerical arrays in Java. Contrary to 
the <i>array of arrays</i> representation that is built into the Java language, the classes in this 
package use one contiguous array and appropriate index operations to access the elements of the 
array.    
</p>
<p>
The number of indices (or axis') of an array is called the <i>rank</i> of the array, the set of 
extends of the array along each of its axis' are called the <i>dimensions</i> of the array.
